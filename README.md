getTrainingImage 
Gets the dimension of the training image and pattern template, with skip-size and multi-grids, and then reads the file and stores the patterns in X (pattern database) each row represents a pattern. Note, in order to see Prototype, Dim and Pat should be odd values.

distanceMatrix 
Calculate the dissimilarity matrix with different methods using X. It puts the result in disMat matrix.

multiDimScale 
Runs multidimensional scaling with 4 different methods. The main one is the first method, where it first does cmdscale and then plots the eigenvalues and correlation coefficients , and then asks for the MDS dimension, and puts the results in Y.

patCluster 
Pattern clustering, with 3 methods, where the first and third one are important. In the third one, it used kernel k-means and puts the number of clusters in clus and uses dualkmeans3 file to do the clustering. It also stores the kernel in 3d in Z.

plotPoints 
Plots the results with different clusters in different colors. For the case of kernel where MDS is -1 it plots also the mesh.

showPatterns 
If the dimensionality of MDS was 2, by clicking on the plot of points you will get the index of the corresponding pattern.

showClusters 
Shows the average of all cluster patterns. It uses calcClusters to do it.

showPrototype 
Plots the clustered categories on the training image.
